        <p>
          We are very pleased about your interest in our company. Data
          protection is a particularly high priority for the management of
          Salloum Company. It is generally possible to use the Salloum Company
          website without providing personal data. However, if a data subject
          wishes to use special services of our company via our website,
          processing of personal data may become necessary. If the processing of
          personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such
          processing, we generally obtain the consent of the data subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of personal data, such as name, address, email address,
          or telephone number of a data subject, is always carried out in
          accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and in
          accordance with the national data protection regulations applicable to
          Salloum Company. By means of this data protection declaration, our
          company aims to inform the public about the type, scope, and purpose
          of the personal data we collect, use, and process. Furthermore, data
          subjects are informed about the rights they are entitled to through
          this data protection declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the data controller, Salloum Company has implemented numerous
          technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
          protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
          data transmission over the Internet can generally have security
          vulnerabilities, so absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this
          reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data to us by
          alternative means, for example by phone.
        </p>
